# Welcome

You are now on the path to writing reproducible and scalable scientific workflows using Nextflow. This guide complements the full [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest) - if you ever have any doubts, please refer to that.

## Objectives

By the end of this course you should:

1. Be proficient in writing Nextflow workflows
2. Know the basic Nextflow concepts of Channels, Processes and Operators
3. Have an understanding of containerized workflows
4. Understand the different execution platforms supported by Nextflow
5. Be introduced to the Nextflow community and ecosystem

## Follow the training videos

Free online training events for this course are run approximately every six months. Videos are streamed to YouTube and questions are handled in the nf-core Slack community. You can watch the recording of the most recent training ([September, 2023](https://nf-co.re/events/2023/training-basic-2023)) in the [YouTube playlist](https://youtu.be/ERbTqLtAkps?si=6xDoDXsb6kGQ_Qa8) below:

## Overview

To get you started with Nextflow as quickly as possible, you will be walked through the following steps:

1. Set up a development environment to run Nextflow
2. Explore Nextflow concepts using some basic workflows, including a multi-step RNA-Seq analysis
3. Build and use Docker containers to encapsulate all workflow dependencies
4. Dive deeper into the core Nextflow syntax, including Channels, Processes, and Operators
5. Cover cluster and cloud deployment scenarios and explore Nextflow Tower capabilities

This will give you a broad understanding of Nextflow, to start writing your own workflows. We hope you enjoy the course! This is an ever-evolving document - feedback is always welcome.
