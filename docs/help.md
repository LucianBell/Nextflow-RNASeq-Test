# Getting Help

## Nextflow Documentation

Even the most proficient developers need documentation.
Nextflow is no different, and has an excellent set of docs.
You can find the Nextflow docs at <https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/> - we recommend keeping them open in a tab whilst you follow the training!

## community.seqera.io

The [Seqera community forum](https://community.seqera.io) is a great place to ask questions about Nextflow. It's also a great place to find answers to questions that have already been asked!

Questions about Nextflow can be asked under the [Nextflow category](https://community.seqera.io/c/nextflow/5) with any relevant tags.

## Slack

If you're struggling with the training please don't hesitate to reach out for help.
Our amazing community is one of the great strengths of Nextflow!

There are two relevant Slack instances:

-   Nextflow ([register here](https://www.nextflow.io/slack-invite.html))
-   nf-core ([register here](https://nf-co.re/join/slack))

Generally, the Nextflow slack is best as it caters for the entire community.
The exception is if you're following the training with a workshop organised by nf-core, in which case you should have been told about where to ask questions.

## Ask the professionals

Nextflow is a free and open-source software, developed by [Seqera](https://seqera.io/).
